  i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner  #
  i am not saying to buy or not to buy but just saying its worth a look,rest u decide #
  i needed something with more power #
  reason for two  #
  the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing  #
  i cannot decide  #
  this camera has features that are similar to others yet different attributes #
  card reader is included  #
  i have high battery needs #
  this camera is a mixed bag, so unable to decide # i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service  # 
 just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted  # 
 after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 

family-phones from at&t to t-mobile  # 
 the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise  # 
 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint  # 
 also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  # 
 however , it serves its purpose  # 
 the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly  # 
 the volume  # 
 forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person  # 
 i was surprised by t-mobile 's service  # 
 i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous  # 
 reason  # 
 they piggy-back on cingular 's service  # 
 also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 #99 / mo # ) ever works  # 
 also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out  #

n i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner  # 
 i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera  # 
 i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300  # 
n i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400  # 
 reason for two  # 
 the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing  # 
b 1  # pictures wo 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  # 
 card reader is included  # 
 3  # with low attery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  # 
 be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  #

 if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data  # 
 so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time  # 
 in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time  # 
 i would rate this is 4 #5 stars picture quality ; imae size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix  # 
 they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts  # ad labor  # 
 you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  # 
 still , had to send it back to nikon for repair  #
 after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us  # 
 i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  #
